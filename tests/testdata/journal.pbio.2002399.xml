<abstract>
<p>The Hippo pathway plays a key role in regulating cell turnover in adult tissues, and abnormalities in this pathway are consistently associated with human cancers. Hippo was initially implicated in the control of cell proliferation and death, and its inhibition is linked to the expansion of stem cells and progenitors, leading to larger organ size and tumor formation. To understand the mechanism by which Hippo directs cell renewal and promotes stemness, we studied its function in planarians. These stem cell–based organisms are ideal models for the analysis of the complex cellular events underlying tissue renewal in the whole organism. <italic>hippo</italic> RNA interference (RNAi) in planarians decreased apoptotic cell death, induced cell cycle arrest, and could promote the dedifferentiation of postmitotic cells. <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi resulted in extensive undifferentiated areas and overgrowths, with no effect on body size or cell number. We propose an essential role for <italic>hippo</italic> in controlling cell cycle, restricting cell plasticity, and thereby preventing tumoral transformation.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Constant cell renewal is required to maintain healthy organs during adult homeostasis. The highly conserved Hippo signaling pathway is essential for the regulation of basic cell behaviors that underlie tissue renewal, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell death. The Hippo protein has been implicated in several human cancers, and its inhibition in mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> promotes the formation of overgrowths. Nonetheless, its biological function remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we studied the role of Hippo in planarians, flatworms that continuously alter their size depending on nutrient availability, and therefore have a high rate of cellular turnover. This ability is sustained by an abundant population of adult totipotent stem cells. We show that hippo inhibition in planarians decreases apoptotic cell death, impairs cell progression through the cell cycle, and causes instability of the differentiated cell fate. These events ultimately lead to the formation of overgrowths consisting of undifferentiated cells. We propose that the main role of Hippo in planarians is not to promote proliferation but to control the cell cycle and maintain a stable differentiated cell fate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The same developmental processes that drive embryogenesis also regulate the constant cell renewal required throughout the natural life span of the organism. Successful cell renewal relies on multiple events, including proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cell populations and death of unnecessary cells. Failure to correctly coordinate these events can lead to diseases such as cancer. Of the multiple molecular mechanisms involved in the control of cellular renewal, the Hippo signaling pathway has emerged as a key hub. Although first identified as a key regulator of organ size through the control of cell death and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref004">4</xref>], growing evidence suggests additional pivotal roles in coordinating stem-cell maintenance, cell differentiation, cell fate decisions, and cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>At the core of the Hippo pathway is a kinase cascade that phosphorylates the nuclear effector Yorkie (Yki) (YAP/TAZ in vertebrates) and targets it for degradation. When the pathway is inactive, dephosphorylated Yki enters the nucleus to regulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref012">12</xref>]. In most organs and tissues, such as the liver, heart, and skin, loss of Hippo signaling, or elevated activity of Yki/YAP/TAZ, is associated with stem-cell expansion, inhibition of cell differentiation, the appearance of overgrowths, and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref015">15</xref>]. In line with these observations, YAP/TAZ is hyperactivated in most human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref016">16</xref>]. Importantly, in regenerative contexts, YAP/TAZ promotes regeneration of the same organs in which it produces tumors under homeostatic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref018">18</xref>]. The Hippo signaling pathway therefore appears to exert a general function, promoting stemness or amplifying the population of progenitors, that is beneficial in regenerating tissues but harmful in homeostatic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite its crucial role in everyday tissue renewal and in the maintenance of healthy organisms, the mechanism by which Hippo signaling promotes stemness remains unclear. Studies performed in several tissue types have extensively demonstrated the positive effect of Hippo inhibition on cell proliferation and the consequent expansion of the resident population of stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref022">22</xref>]. However, recent studies in the liver and intestine, as well as in embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell cultures, have shown that both Hippo down-regulation and YAP/TAZ nuclearization increase the plasticity of differentiated cells, allowing their dedifferentiation towards a stem-cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref025">25</xref>]. The plasticity of cells within the hierarchical organization of a tissue has major implications for regenerative medicine and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>To better understand the role of the Hippo pathway in driving adult cellular renewal and specifically in promoting cell stemness, we studied its function in planarians. Owing to the presence of a population of pluripotent adult stem cells (called cNeoblasts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref030">30</xref>], planarians have the ability to constantly grow and degrow depending on food availability and to regenerate any missing body part within a few days. Several lineage-restricted cycling cells (or lineage-restricted neoblasts) and their postmitotic descendants can be identified in planarians based on the expression of tissue-specific transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref032">32</xref>]. In addition to the presence of a stem cell population, the continuous activation of signaling cues that coordinate cell death and cell renewal and direct precise cell fate decisions allow planarians to maintain proportioned and functional organs during growth/degrowth and regeneration. This continuous active regulation of the stem cell and postmitotic cell compartments makes the planarian an ideal in vivo model of the different events underlying homeostatic cell renewal and tissue regeneration. Furthermore, in contrast to most models of regeneration, planarian regeneration is fueled directly by the expansion of an abundant stem cell population, precluding the need for dedifferentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we investigate whether down-regulation of Hippo signaling exerts its stemness-promoting effect by increasing the proliferation of resident stem cells or by promoting cell dedifferentiation. We show that inhibition of <italic>Smed-hippo</italic> (referred to hereafter as <italic>hippo</italic>) in planarians reduces apoptotic activity and increases mitotic rates. However, this imbalance between cell death and mitotic activity does not lead to an increase in planarian body size or cell number, possibly because <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi does not increase the number of cycling cells but rather blocks mitotic exit and increases necrotic cell death. <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> planarians develop overgrowths and extensive regions composed of undifferentiated cells, accompanied by a general decrease in the number of differentiated cells throughout the body. A detailed study of the epidermal lineage reveals that <italic>hippo</italic> is required to determine the hierarchical transitions necessary for proper epidermal differentiation from epidermal-restricted stem cells to differentiated epidermal cells. Finally, our results indicate that <italic>hippo</italic> is required to maintain the differentiated state in planarian cells, because <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition could promote dedifferentiation of postmitotic cells. Overall, our results indicate that the overgrowths and undifferentiated regions observed after <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition in planarians are not caused by an imbalance between cell death and proliferation but by the inability of cells to reach and maintain the appropriate fate. We propose an essential role for <italic>hippo</italic> in restricting cell plasticity and hence in preventing tumoral transformation.</p>

<p>To determine whether the appearance of overgrowths was caused by an imbalance between cell death and cell proliferation, we performed TUNEL and caspase-3 assays and quantified mitotic activity by anti-phospho-Histone 3 immunostaining (H3P). After 2 weeks of inhibition, <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals exhibited a reduction in cell death compared to controls that became more evident after 3 weeks of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). After 3 weeks of <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi, the number of apoptotic cells was reduced compared to controls, and mitotic activity was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s002">S2C Fig</xref>).

Our results thus indicate that Hippo promotes apoptotic cell death and controls mitotic activity and that its inhibition leads to the formation of unpigmented regions and overgrowths, without affecting animal size or cell number.</p>

<title>Hippo is essential for proper cell cycle progression</title>
<p>Studies using other animal models have reported that <italic>hippo</italic> dysregulation results in defects in cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref037">37</xref>]. This effect could provide a plausible explanation for our observation that the decrease in cell death and increase in mitotic activity in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals do not lead to changes in cell number. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and analyzed the proportion of cells in M and S phase 16 h later in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals and corresponding controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). We found comparable numbers of EdU+ cells in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals and controls, indicating that similar numbers of cells enter the cell cycle in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Moreover, double staining with anti-EdU and anti-H3P revealed an increase in the number of EdU+/H3P+ double-positive cells in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). This suggests that in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals, cells either transition faster from S to M phase and/or fail to complete M phase. The higher number of EdU-/H3P+ cells in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s003">S3B Fig</xref>) indicates that the former group harbors a greater number of cells that are in M phase but have not passed through S phase in the previous 16 h. Thus, <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi results in the trapping of cells in M phase but does not affect the number entering the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). This could explain why the increase in the number of H3P+ cells does not translate to an increase in cell number. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition results in faster transit of cells from S to M phase.</p>

<p>To further understand the role of <italic>hippo</italic> in the cell cycle, we examined the organization of the mitotic spindle and chromosomes in dissociated cells from <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals by double immunostaining with anti-α-tubulin and anti-H3P antibodies. The results revealed abnormal microtubule organization of prophase/prometaphase spindles and spindle poles in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Similarly, metaphase cells showed disorganized and less dense arrays of spindle microtubules, as well as chromosome alignment defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> cells, more than a half of all anaphases appeared in an early phase, while in controls, all were classified as late anaphases. Half of the early anaphases in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> cells were characterized by a disorganized and less dense microtubule array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). This result supports an essential role of <italic>hippo</italic> in the normal cell cycle progression and is consistent with the increase in the number of cells in M phase, but not S phase, observed after <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi.</p>
<p>In agreement with the role of Hippo in cell cycle progression and specifically in the mitotic phase, we found that several genes related to cytokinesis and mitotic spindle organization were differentially expressed in the <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> RNA sequencing analysis (RNAseq) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s014">S1 Table</xref>).

<p>Detailed analysis of the overgrowths caused by <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) revealed that they are caused by the accumulation of cells in the subepidermal region or the mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) and in some cases arise from the submuscular plexus region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s011">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s013">S3</xref> Movies).

<p>In addition to the specific overgrown regions, broader unpigmented areas were also observed in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Analysis with specific markers revealed that differentiated structures such as the nervous system, the eyes, and the digestive system were not properly renewed or maintained in those unpigmented areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g003">Fig 3C–3C”</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals had a poorly developed digestive system, smaller pharynx and eyes (which, in some cases, were almost absent), and smaller brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), consistent with general defects in the maintenance of differentiated structures. Notably, the smaller brains appeared to be surrounded by ectopic mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Analysis of the <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> RNAseq further indicated that most of the markers associated with terminal differentiation of multiple cell types (<italic>opsin</italic>, <italic>pantothenate kinase 1</italic>, <italic>synapsin</italic>, <italic>tropomyosin</italic>) were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), consistent with a general defect in the process of cell differentiation or maintenance of the differentiated state. Quantification of the number of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons by ISH with the corresponding markers (<italic>tyrosine hydroxylase</italic> and <italic>tryptophan hydroxylase 1</italic>) further confirmed the general decrease in the number of differentiated neurons in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> planarian heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>In several animals, the disappearance of differentiated structures coincided with the presence of cell-depleted regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). Therefore, using in vivo propidium iodide (PI) incorporation analysis, we investigated whether a general increase in cell death occurred in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals. The results revealed an increase in PI+ cells in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Because we previously showed that caspase-dependent cell death is decreased in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals, we can conclude that necrotic cell death is increased. This increase in necrosis could compensate for the decrease in apoptosis and contribute to the maintenance of cell number in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data indicate that Hippo plays an important role in the maintenance or renewal of differentiated tissues in planarians and that its inhibition leads to the appearance of extensive regions of undifferentiated cells that accumulate in overgrowths.</p>

<p>Although Yki/YAP is a highly evolutionarily conserved downstream element of the Hippo pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref005">5</xref>], it has been proposed that Yki does not act downstream of Hippo in planarians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref034">34</xref>]. To investigate the possible conservation of Hippo-Yki signaling in the control of planarian cell differentiation, we generated a specific anti-Yki antibody to determine the levels and pattern of Yki expression.

<p>The epidermal lineage is the most abundant in planarians and its progression and determination is well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref044">44</xref>]. Epidermal maturation requires temporally correlated transition states in planarians, in which stem cells (<italic>smedwi-1+</italic>) become postmitotic and start to sequentially express <italic>nb21/32</italic>, <italic>agat</italic>, and <italic>vimentin</italic> (<italic>vim</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref045">45</xref>]. In parallel, epidermal precursors migrate from the inner parenchyma towards the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref044">44</xref>].

<p>To gain further insight into cell fate progression in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals, we analyzed the number and distribution of mitotic cells (H3P+), stem cells (<italic>smedwi-1+</italic>), and postmitotic epidermal cells (<italic>nb21/32+</italic>, <italic>agat+</italic>, or <italic>vim+</italic>). First, we quantified H3P+ cells in 4 different regions (inner to outermost) in transverse sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We observed a significant increase in the number of mitotic cells (H3P+) in the 2 outermost regions of <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals as compared with controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s005">S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s008">S8B</xref> Figs). <italic>vim</italic>+ cells were located mainly in the epidermis (fully differentiated cells) of control animals but were predominantly detected in the mesenchyme of <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g005">Fig 5B and 5B′</xref>). This indicates that <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi impairs the acquisition or maintenance of epithelial fate or the migration of epidermal cells. We detected higher numbers of <italic>vim+</italic>/ SMEDWI-1+ cells in the mesenchyme of <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals versus control animals, in which these cells were virtually absent from the mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g005">Fig 5B–5B″</xref>). This finding, together with the presence of ectopic mitotic cells, suggests impairment of the differentiation or fate maintenance, but not the migration, of epidermal cells following <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition.</p>
<p>Quantification of cells that were double positive for different epidermal markers revealed an increase in <italic>smedwi-1</italic>+/<italic>agat</italic>+, <italic>nb</italic>+/<italic>agat</italic>+, and <italic>agat</italic>+/<italic>vim</italic>+ cells in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This increase in bivalent cells in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals is consistent with failure of the epidermal cells to progress appropriately through the hierarchical transitions that occur during epidermal lineage specification and suggests that they are unable to maintain a defined fate. Interestingly, double labeling of H3P+/<italic>agat</italic>+, H3P+/<italic>nb32</italic>+, or H3P+/<italic>smedwi-1</italic>+ revealed that mitotic cells were always <italic>smedwi-1</italic>+ but never <italic>agat</italic>+ nor <italic>nb32</italic>+ in either <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals or controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that ectopic mitotic cells could arise from a different lineage or from aberrant migration of stem cells, our findings suggest that mitotic cells never express postmitotic markers.</p>
<p>Supporting the view that <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition interferes with specification of the epidermal lineage, analysis of the <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> RNA sequence revealed an increase in the expression of markers of ζ-neoblasts (<italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>p53</italic>), which are precursors of the epidermal lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref031">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). This increase could be caused by an increase in the number of ζ-neoblasts. However, we found that while expression levels of <italic>smedwi-1</italic>, a general marker of stem cells, decreased in the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), the number of cells expressing this marker was unchanged in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s008">S8D Fig</xref>). As such, the increased expression of ζ-neoblast markers could also be due to increased expression of those markers in ζ-neoblasts or to incorrect acquisition of their expression by other cell types.</p>
<p>Taken together, our analysis of the epidermal lineage reveals an increase in the population of cells co-expressing cell markers that define different epidermal cell lineages in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals, as well as mislocalization of these markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Thus, precursors and differentiated epidermal cells are both improperly defined and mislocalized. These results indicate that <italic>hippo</italic> is essential for the acquisition and/or maintenance of cell fate in the epidermal lineage.</p>

<title>The Hippo pathway maintains the differentiated state in planarians</title>
<p>The presence of large numbers of undifferentiated cells and overgrowths following <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi could be explained either by defective differentiation of stem cells towards a specific fate or by a dedifferentiation process in which postmitotic cells are unable to maintain the committed state and begin to express stem-cell markers. To investigate the possibility that postmitotic cells undergo dedifferentiation, we depleted the stem-cell population in planarians through X-ray irradiation followed by the inhibition of <italic>hippo</italic> over 4 consecutive days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). ISH for <italic>smedwi-1</italic> revealed that after lethal irradiation (60 Gy) no <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells were detectable in either controls or <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). However, in planarians that received irradiation at sublethal doses (17.5 Gy), <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition increased the number of <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s009">S9C Fig</xref>). Importantly, anti-H3P immunostaining revealed no difference in the number of mitotic cells between sublethally irradiated/<italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> planarians and their corresponding controls, indicating that the increase in <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells cannot be attributed to increased proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s009">S9D Fig</xref>). Because DNA damage induced by high doses of irradiation could mask the possible effect of <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition on cell dedifferentiation, we next investigated the effects of <italic>histone 2b</italic> (<italic>h2b</italic>) inhibition as an alternative means of depleting the neoblast population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref046">46</xref>], followed by <italic>hippo RNAi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). qPCR analysis using specific primers for <italic>h2b</italic> and <italic>hippo</italic> confirmed inhibition of both genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s010">S10A Fig</xref>). ISH for <italic>smedwi-1</italic> revealed no differences between <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals and controls (the “<italic>smedwi-1</italic> WT” phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), whereas in <italic>h2b (RNAi)</italic> animals, <italic>smedwi-1</italic> expression was completely absent (“no <italic>smedwi-1</italic>” phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) (45%), or reduced to a few scattered cells (“disperse <italic>smedwi-1</italic>+ cells” phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) (55%), which corresponded to stem cells that escaped the effects of <italic>h2b</italic> inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Strikingly, several animals in the <italic>h2b/hippo (RNAi)</italic> group had clusters of <italic>smedwi-1</italic>+ cells in the marginal region of the body (“<italic>smedwi-1</italic> clusters” phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) (58.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Interestingly, this corresponded to the region in which ectopic mitosis and overgrowths were observed. Moreover, despite the presence of <italic>smedwi-1</italic> clusters, the number of H3P+ cells in <italic>h2b/hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals was comparable to that of <italic>h2b (RNAi)</italic> animals and was much lower than that of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In addition, EdU incorporation analysis revealed that the percentage of <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells that entered the cell cycle in <italic>h2b/hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals was lower than that of <italic>h2b</italic> (RNAi) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). This result supports the view that <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells originate from distinct populations in <italic>h2b (RNAi)</italic> and <italic>h2b/hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals. Taken together, our data suggest that the clusters of <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells found in <italic>h2b/hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals are not the result of the proliferation of remaining stem cells that escape <italic>h2b</italic> inhibition but are produced by dedifferentiation of postmitotic cells that regain the expression of stem-cell markers.</p>

<p>To better understand the nature of <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells in <italic>h2b/hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals, we investigated whether the expression of different neoblast markers was also increased. The results revealed that expression of the stem-cell marker <italic>bruli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref047">47</xref>] was also increased, although not to the same degree as <italic>smedwi-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s010">S10C Fig</xref>). Because our previous results showed that <italic>hippo</italic> is required to properly maintain epidermal fate and that the expression of ζ-neoblast markers is increased after <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi, we analyzed the <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> clusters observed in <italic>h2b/hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals for expression of the ζ-neoblast marker <italic>zfp1</italic>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we show that <italic>hippo</italic> is required to regulate the apoptotic and mitotic response in starved degrowing planarians. <italic>hippo RNAi</italic> resulted in an increase in the number of mitotic cells and a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells. Importantly, and in contrast to reports in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref049">49</xref>], the imbalance between apoptosis and mitosis observed following <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition did not lead to changes in planarian body size or cell number. This observation may be explained by the increase in the number of necrotic cells after <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition. Furthermore, the fact that the increase in the number of cells in M phase in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals was not accompanied by an increase in the number of cells in S phase may also contribute to the maintenance of the cell number in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> planarians. Our findings demonstrate that in planarians, Hippo is essential for proper cell cycle progression and, specifically, for successful completion of mitosis. The role of core Hippo signaling elements in critical mitotic events, namely in centrosomal duplication, chromosomal alignment, spindle formation, and completion of cytokinesis, has also been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref053">53</xref>]. Planarian <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> cells showed improper assembly of the mitotic spindle. This effect, together with the number of genes directly involved in mitosis that are differentially regulated in the <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> transcriptome, suggests a direct role of Hippo in regulating their expression. For instance, centriolin, which is required to complete cytokinesis, was down-regulated in the <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> transcriptome. Corroborating the important role of Hippo in the cell cycle in planarians, in the transcriptome we detected several genes previously reported to mediate the requirement of Hippo for proper cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s014">S1 Table</xref>). Despite defective mitotic exit, <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals showed no tissue regression, the phenotype normally associated with loss of the cycling cell population in planarians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref029">29</xref>]. Indeed, the total population of stem cells or neoblasts (<italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells) was maintained in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals. This suggests that only a fraction of the cells that enter the cell cycle become arrested in M phase after <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition. Supporting this view, around 30% of mitotic figures in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> cells were defective.</p>
<p>There is a second possible explanation for the observation that the imbalance between apoptosis and mitosis in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals does not lead to changes in total cell number: a fraction of the cells found in M phase could arise from the dedifferentiation of postmitotic cells. Supporting this hypothesis, in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> planarians we detected ectopic mitotic cells in the periphery, a region in which postmitotic cells are normally located. These mitotic cells also exhibited aberrant co-expression of committed epidermal cell markers and therefore are unlikely to be the result of incorrect migration of stem cells, which are normally located in the innermost part of the organism. Moreover, the boundaries of expression of the epidermal markers corresponding to the entire lineage were not conserved, indicating that <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition impairs the maintenance of cell identity. The poorly committed cells found in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals could arise during the process of differentiation or could be the product of induced cell dedifferentiation. Importantly, we found that <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition in planarians depleted of cycling cells (or neoblasts) may promote dedifferentiation of postmitotic cells. It should be stressed that although a process of cell dedifferentiation that allows re-entry in the cell cycle is common in regenerative models, it has never been described in animals with the level of plasticity found in planarians, which fulfill their regenerative and renewal requirements by activating proliferation of their abundant population of totipotent stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref054">54</xref>]. Thus, our data strongly indicate that <italic>hippo</italic> plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the differentiated state and that its inhibition promotes dedifferentiation.</p>
<p>Hippo inhibition in planarians promotes the formation of overgrowths, as described in all models in which it has been studied to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref055">55</xref>]. Although early studies of the Hippo pathway in model organisms attributed the appearance of tumors to an imbalance between cell death and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref055">55</xref>], our results indicate that the inability of cells to maintain the differentiated state following <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition may underlie the appearance of undifferentiated regions and the formation of overgrowths, which also consisted of undifferentiated cells. In agreement with this hypothesis, the formation of overgrowths was preceded by the appearance of large areas in which different tissues, including those pertaining to the neural, digestive, and visual systems, showed a loss of differentiated cell types. Those results are in good agreement with recently published findings supporting an essential role of <italic>hippo</italic> in restricting cell plasticity in the liver and intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref023">23</xref>], an effect that has been linked to its role in the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref056">56</xref>]. Thus, nuclear Yki/YAP, rather than pluripotency, could exert a critical role in conferring plasticity, which is a crucial property of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>The formation of overgrowths could be due to the inhibition of apoptosis induced following <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi, in addition to the increase in cell plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In wild-type animals, senescent cells and cells with DNA disarrangements are eliminated by apoptosis. However, these cells could not be eliminated in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals and may contribute to the acquisition of additional genetic or epigenetic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Furthermore, the number of cells with DNA rearrangements and aneuploidies is probably increased in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> planarians, because, according to our results, those animals display dysregulation of critical mitotic regulators and fail to complete cytokinesis, as previously demonstrated in LATS2 knockout mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref036">36</xref>]. Importantly, the control of apoptosis is intrinsically linked to genomic instability and malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref058">58</xref>]. It must be noted that the cell death that is inhibited after <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition in our experimental conditions is the one induced by starvation. However, it is likely that the damage-induced apoptosis also depends on <italic>hippo</italic>, because both starvation- and damage-induced apoptosis depend on such common mechanisms as JNK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref059">59</xref>].</p>

<title>Model of the <italic>hippo</italic> function in planarians.</title>
<p>In wild-type animals, stem cells or neoblasts can proliferate or can become committed and differentiate into specific cell types. Committed cells exit the cell cycle to proceed to the differentiation process. The health and number of postmitotic cells is also controlled by programmed cell death. In <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> planarians, proliferating stem cells or neoblasts become trapped in M phase (1), and fewer of these cells undergo apoptosis (2). Both alterations may lead to genomic instability, because the failure to exit M phase is linked to DNA damage, and inhibition of the apoptotic response hampers the elimination of damaged and old cells. <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition also promotes cell plasticity and facilitates cell dedifferentiation (3). Both genomic instability and cell plasticity could promote the appearance of undifferentiated areas and overgrowths. RNAi, RNA interference.</p>

</fig>
<p>Taking into account the location of the overgrowths in the subepidermal region, which is abundant in epidermal precursors and is also the location of ectopic mitotic cells, it is tempting to speculate that the epidermal lineage is the origin of the cell accumulations in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals. Epidermal cell plasticity promoted by <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition could account for the appearance of bivalent cells that are susceptible to tumoral transformation. Furthermore, although the total number of stem cells was not altered after <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition, we observed a marked increase in the expression of markers of ζ-neoblasts, the precursors of epidermal cells, underscoring the important role of the pathway in restricting the fate of this specific lineage. However, the fact that <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition in planarians depleted of cycling cells (or neoblasts) resulted in the formation of <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cell clusters that did not express the ζ-neoblast marker <italic>zfp1</italic> does not support an epidermal origin. A deeper analysis of the molecular features of these <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells will be required to determine whether they arise from a nonepidermal cell type or, alternatively, whether dedifferentiation keeps the cells in a more pluripotent state. Nonetheless, the fact that almost all markers of differentiation were down-regulated in the <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> transcriptome and the appearance of undifferentiated areas affecting neuronal, epithelial, and digestive cells in <italic>hippo (RNAi)</italic> animals indicate that <italic>hippo</italic> controls the fate of several cell types and that different cell lineages could contribute to the overgrowths observed. To understand whether <italic>hippo</italic> exerts a predominant role in specific tissues, it will be necessary to determine whether precursor cell markers are also aberrantly co-expressed following <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition in other cell types.</p>
<p>In addition to its role in maintaining cell fate, <italic>hippo</italic> may also be required for proper cell differentiation, as reported in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref014">14</xref>]. In our study, the role of <italic>hippo</italic> in cell differentiation was more evident in the context of regeneration, because the decrease in the number of differentiated cells observed in newly regenerating blastemas, despite the increase in mitotic cells, could not directly result from dedifferentiation. Moreover, the observed defects in differentiation may be caused by the dedifferentiation of postmitotic cells in pre-existing tissue after <italic>hippo</italic> RNAi, as previously described in intact animals, leading to misexpression by differentiated muscle cells of signaling molecules required for proper differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref060">60</xref>]. This possibility is consistent with the phenotype generated after <italic>yki</italic> inhibition in planarians, in which an increase in signaling molecules and differentiated cells is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002399.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002399.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The results presented here support an essential role for <italic>hippo</italic> in the acquisition and maintenance of differentiated cell fates. Thus, as demonstrated in other models, Hippo favors stemness in planarians. Importantly, although planarians possess an abundant population of totipotent stem cells, <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition promotes stemness not by increasing stem cell renewal and expansion of the stem cell compartment but rather by promoting cell plasticity and thus dedifferentiation of postmitotic cells. This finding has profound implications in the fields of regenerative medicine and cancer therapy, because the acquisition of plasticity by lineage-committed cells favors wound healing but also promotes tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref061">61</xref>]. Accordingly, the cell plasticity induced by <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition is associated with beneficial effects in the context of heart and liver regeneration in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref018">18</xref>]. However, <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition in planarians, which have a much greater regenerative ability than vertebrates, impairs rather than promotes regeneration. One explanation for these contrasting effects is that in vertebrate regenerative systems, a process of cell dedifferentiation that allows re-entry in the cell cycle fuels the regenerative response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref063">63</xref>], whereas in planarians, expansion of the stem cell population is the only source of new cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002399.ref033">33</xref>]. In homeostatic conditions, when basal cell renewal is required, <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition is also deleterious in planarians, because tumoral transformation is facilitated by the sustained increase in cell plasticity and the probable chromosomal instability induced by the cell cycle defects and the inhibition of apoptosis. The fact that we observed no overgrowths in regenerating regions further underscores the importance of the sustained effect of <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition in specific cell types to promote transformation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present findings demonstrate that in a stem cell–based system such as the planarian, the main role of the Hippo pathway is not to control the balance between proliferating and dying cells nor to regulate body size or the stem-cell population; in planarians, <italic>hippo</italic> is required to successfully complete the cell cycle and to promote apoptosis. Furthermore, <italic>hippo</italic> is necessary to acquire and maintain cell fate, thus restricting cell plasticity. Consequently, long-term <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition prevents tissue renewal and leads to the formation of overgrowths.</p>
<p>Although further evidence is required, our results suggest that in planarians, as described in other organisms, <italic>hippo</italic> may be involved in maintenance of the chromatin state and the genome stability of stem cells and postmitotic descendants. This function would explain the systematic alteration of <italic>hippo</italic> signaling elements in many types of cancer, as well as the proregenerative effect of the induction of Yki nuclearization. However, it remains unclear why <italic>hippo</italic> elements are mutated in most human tumors but never at their onset, whereas in model organisms, the appearance of overgrowths is a consistent feature of <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition. Finally, our results highlight the potentially hazardous effects of manipulating the <italic>hippo</italic> pathway for medical purposes in regenerative medicine if the stem cells and progenitors induced after <italic>hippo</italic> inhibition are in fact poorly committed cells.</p>
