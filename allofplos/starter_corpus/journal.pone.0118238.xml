<abstract>
<p>The plant hormone auxin plays a central role in growth and morphogenesis. In shoot apical meristems, auxin flux is polarized through its interplay with PIN proteins. Concentration-based mathematical models of the flux can explain some aspects of phyllotaxis for the L1 surface layer, where auxin accumulation points act as sinks and develop into primordia. The picture differs in the interior of the meristem, where the primordia act as auxin sources, leading to the initiation of the vascular system. Self-organization of the auxin flux involves large numbers of molecules and is difficult to treat by intuitive reasoning alone; mathematical models are therefore vital to understand these phenomena. We consider a leading computational model based on the so-called flux hypothesis. This model has been criticized and extended in various ways. One of the basic counter-arguments is that simulations yield auxin concentrations inside canals that are lower than those seen experimentally. Contrary to what is claimed in the literature, we show that the model can lead to higher concentrations within canals for significant parameter regimes. We then study the model in the usual case where the response function Φ defining the model is quadratic and unbounded, and show that the steady state vascular patterns are formed of loopless directed trees. Moreover, we show that PIN concentrations can diverge in finite time, thus explaining why previous simulation studies introduced cut-offs which force the system to have bounded PIN concentrations. Hence, contrary to previous claims, extreme PIN concentrations are not due to numerical problems but are intrinsic to the model. On the other hand, we show that PIN concentrations remain bounded for bounded Φ, and simulations show that in this case, loops can emerge at steady state.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Among its many functions, the plant hormone auxin is known to induce the formation of primordia in the shoot apical meristem, at locations where it accumulates at sufficient levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref001">1</xref>]. As these primordia become plant organs, the distribution of auxin at the microscopic scale of meristems is a fundamental determinant of the final shape of the plant at the macroscopic scale. The molecular mechanisms underlying auxin patterning are not fully known, but it is clearly established that auxin is actively transported between cells by transporter proteins, including the family of PIN proteins. Although it is known that the distribution of these transporters on cell membranes is asymmetric and depends on the distribution of auxin in neighbouring cells, the molecular details of this dependency remains a crucial unknown in the biology of auxin.</p>
<p>PIN proteins have been identified as efflux carriers (i.e., they transport auxin out of the cell to the intercellular space), and are either oriented towards or against the auxin gradient, depending on the developmental stage of the primordium. More precisely, PIN proteins initially orient themselves towards a precise region of the meristem, away from older primordia. Auxin accumulates at the PIN convergence point, and induces the formation of a new primordium; during this phase, PIN are oriented against the auxin gradient. Incipient primordia then act as auxin sinks and induce auxin depletion in surrounding cells. Soon after initiation, PIN orientation switches in adaxial cells (i.e. cells placed on the side towards the axis of a primordium, usually the upper side) from “towards the center” to “towards the outside” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118238.g001">Fig. 1</xref>), whereas PIN in the primordium orient themselves basally towards the inner tissue of the meristem (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118238.g001">Fig. 1 a</xref>). These processes lead to canalization, that is, to the development of vascular strands which transport auxin downward from the primordium to inner tissues. As reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref002">2</xref>], PIN polarization reversal is enhanced by the increase of auxin synthesis in incipient primordia soon after their initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref004">4</xref>]. To date, it is not established how PIN is oriented in response to auxin gradients, see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref005">5</xref>] for a recent review.</p>

<p>The gaps in knowledge and the complexity induced by the large numbers of molecules at both intra- and inter-cellular scales make it difficult to treat the process by intuitive reasoning alone; mathematical models are therefore required to understand these phenomena and propose biologically plausible scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref006">6</xref>]. Based on experimental results, many authors including [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref012">12</xref>] have built computational models relying on the following hypotheses: auxin is synthesized in all cells of the shoot apical meristem at rates that may vary, and is transported from cell to cell passively by diffusion and actively through efflux and influx carriers. The different models can be classified in two main classes, depending on the key hypothesis underlying PIN orientation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118238.g002">Fig. 2</xref>):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The <bold>flux-based hypothesis</bold> is based on the work of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref013">13</xref>], and was first formalized by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref015">15</xref>] and later by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref016">16</xref>]. The assumption is that PIN concentration increases in membranes according to the strength of the auxin flux. This induces a positive feedback loop on the auxin flux, which is then amplified. It was first introduced as an intuitive explanation for the venation process. Models based on this hypothesis have been used to reproduce correctly the orientation of PIN proteins towards and against the auxin gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref010">10</xref>], leading to the canalization/venation process. However, flux-based models have been criticized because of the lack of evidence for the existence of auxin flux sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The <bold>concentration-based hypothesis</bold> is based on the experimental result that PIN proteins orient towards incipient primordia, and thus presumably toward auxin maxima. In these models it is assumed that the rate at which PIN proteins accumulate on a membrane depends on the auxin concentration in the neighbouring cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref011">11</xref>]. How does a cell detect the auxin concentration in neighbouring cells? [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref009">9</xref>] cites an experimental result of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref018">18</xref>] showing the negative feedback of auxin concentration on PIN endocytosis (a process which removes PIN from the membrane to the cytosol). Moreover, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref019">19</xref>] proposed the following explanation: auxin accumulation in cells induces growth and expansion, which can be detected by the neighbouring cells due to mechanical forces applied on the cell membrane.</p>

<p>Most published studies have investigated models relying on one or both of the above hypotheses by means of computer simulations, aiming to reproduce realistic auxin distribution patterns in ‘virtual meristems’. However, any mathematical implementation of these hypotheses involves a large number of parameters, few of which are experimentally known to date. The exact patterning abilities of each model, sometimes the source of scientific controversy, thus cannot be fully characterized by these simulations: the fact that a particular type of pattern has not been observed in simulations might simply be explained by unexplored parameter regimes.</p>
<p>Until new experimental data more precisely explain the underlying molecular mechanisms and parameter values, the only possible definitive assessment of a model is through rigorous mathematical deduction and the derivation of formal proofs. As all existing models are high-dimensional and non-linear, only a few such results have been obtained to date.</p>
<p>In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref011">11</xref>], concentration-based models have been shown to produce auxin patterns in a way that is similar to the well-known reaction-diffusion models, through transport-induced bifurcations from a steady state corresponding to a homogeneous distribution of auxin. In particular, these models can produce a variety of spotted and striped patterns, reminiscent of primordia and veins, respectively. The same class of models were investigated more recently in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref020">20</xref>], where it was proved that typical patterns took the form of isolated blocks within a background of auxin-depleted cells. Using rigorous numerical bifurcation techniques, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref021">21</xref>] were able to show that a typical bifurcation from a homogeneous auxin steady state could lead to either regularly-spaced spikes of auxin, or to stable oscillations. For flux-based models, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref016">16</xref>] have shown that different distributions of PIN can lead to a homogeneous auxin distribution, and that these PIN patterns can be characterized in graph-theoretical terms. These authors also give conditions under which homogeneous auxin patterns are stable, and show that stable oscillations of auxin can occur in 1-D rows of cells through flux-based transport.</p>
<p>In this paper, we continue the study of flux-based models. We focus on the equations proposed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref010">10</xref>] as they have been able to reproduce PIN polarization toward incipient primordia (and thus against the auxin gradient), the reversed polarization (along the auxin gradient), phyllotactic patterns and venation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref010">10</xref>] proposed that the two different PIN polarization behaviours are consequences of different cellular responses to auxin. In the cells of the epidermal layer, the response function linking auxin flux to PIN insertion on the membrane is assumed to be linear, whereas the inner tissue response function is assumed quadratic.</p>
<p>However, several simulation studies raised problems for the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref023">23</xref>], the canals were predicted to contain reduced auxin concentrations, while experimental studies show that auxin concentrations within canals can be higher than the background concentration, see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref024">24</xref>] or [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref025">25</xref>]. The model has thus been extended in various ways. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref026">26</xref>] modeled auxin influx carriers. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref023">23</xref>] combined both (the concentration- and flux-based hypotheses) in a hybrid model, each cell having both (flux- and concentration-based PIN cycling) depending on the auxin concentration. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref012">12</xref>] modified the model of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref010">10</xref>] by also considering PIN cycling and the concentration within the cytosol of each cell. They argued that it is then able to predict canals with higher auxin concentration than in the surrounding tissues.</p>
<p>Here we will show that the model of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref010">10</xref>] is itself able to generate auxin canals and PIN polarization with and against auxin gradients, and prove that it is in fact able to create canals having higher auxin concentrations than those in the surrounding cells. Mathematical proofs are given that lead to precise parameter regimes that yield such behaviours. Hence, contrary to what is claimed in the literature, the model reproduces patterns of auxin concentrations like those seen in nature. Previous studies dealing with an unbounded response function introduced a cut-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref012">12</xref>] or halted simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref007">7</xref>] when auxin and PIN concentrations became too high; the authors argued that this behaviour was due to numerical problems. We prove that an intrinsic property of the model is divergence in finite time, and thus that high values of PIN concentration are not due to numerical problems but are a consequence of the computational model itself. We finally study the steady state patterns. These are, at least for quadratic response functions, composed of directed forests of directed trees rooted at sinks, in the absence of cycles. They thus ressemble the plant vascular system. Special emphasis is given to source- and sink-driven systems, for which exact solutions are provided.</p>

The first <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0118238.e022">equation (1a)</xref> gives the rate of variation of auxin concentration in cell <italic>i</italic> as a function of protein production and degradation, and of the flux <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>→<italic>j</italic></sub> through the membrane <italic>ij</italic>. The second equation reflects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref013">13</xref>] original concept that canalization is induced by a positive feedback between flux and transport.

The positive feedback mechanism is modelled by assuming that <italic>h</italic> is increasing and non-negative. It is furthermore assumed that no PIN proteins are removed from the membrane when the number of incoming auxin molecules is larger than the number of outgoing auxin molecules; in mathematical terms, this means that

<title>Divergence in finite time</title>
<p>Most of the papers dealing with (1) or (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0118238.e044">St0</xref>) with unbounded Φ introduce a cut-off or stopped simulations when the values of PIN concentrations <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> became too large (see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref012">12</xref>]). These papers argue that this divergence is due to numerical problems. We show that these extreme values are not due to numerical problems, but that the <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) can diverge toward ∞ in finite time; this is hence an intrinsic property of the computational model. We prove in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0118238.s001">S1 Text</xref> that the slow <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0118238.e044">equation (St0)</xref> has an unique solution, which is defined for all <italic>t</italic> ≥ 0 when Φ is a bounded function if <inline-formula id="pone.0118238.e047"><mml:math id="M47" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>α</mml:mi> <mml:mi>a</mml:mi> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msubsup> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:msubsup><mml:mi>β</mml:mi> <mml:mi>a</mml:mi> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msubsup> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>μ</mml:mi> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> <mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, ∀<italic>i</italic> ∈ <italic>V</italic>.

<p>Note that the result above applies at a limit where the diffusion constant vanishes <italic>D</italic> = 0, and for regular tissues where all cells have the same volume and surface area. Neither of these two conditions is likely to be strictly satisfied in real systems, but they greatly simplify mathematical analysis. Also, we expect Theorem 1 to remain true for systems where the two conditions are nearly satisfied, i.e. where <italic>D</italic> is non-zero but small, and where cells do not vary too much in size. This intuition was confirmed by numerical simulations, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118238.g005">Fig. 5 c</xref>) where the previously observed steady-state is qualitatively unchanged by slightly relaxing the two conditions.</p>

<p>As stated in the Introduction, experiments show that the primordia of the L1 layer later act as auxin sources from where the internal vascular system initiates. We study here the vascular patterns predicted by the flux-based model when there is an isolated primordium. This model has been criticized because of a perceived inability to produce high auxin concentrations inside initiating veins, see, e.g, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref023">23</xref>] and the references therein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref028">28</xref>]. Contrary to this claim, we will prove that the model can correctly predict auxin concentrations. In the following, we assume that there is a primordium located at <italic>i</italic><sub>0</sub>, with auxin production rate higher than that of the other cells. Mathematically, we assume here that

<p>Thus, contrary to what has been claimed in previous studies, see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118238.ref023">23</xref>] and the references therein, the flux-based model does not necessarily lead to auxin concentrations within canals that are lower than the background concentration <italic>α</italic>/<italic>β</italic> associated with isolated cells. Instead, the resulting configuration depends on the source-strength of <italic>i</italic><sub>0</sub> (<inline-formula id="pone.0118238.e110"><mml:math id="M110" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>α</mml:mi> <mml:mi>a</mml:mi> <mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) relatively to the other cells (i.e <italic>α</italic>). One also observes the following counter-intuitive and surprising result: the flux increases along the vein when the production rate <italic>α</italic><sub>0</sub> of the source is low, whereas the flux decreases for highly productive sources with large <italic>α</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have studied various aspects of the flux-based auxin transport computational model. The model has been criticized because numerical simulations indicate that auxin concentrations within initiating veins are lower than those seen experimentally. Various extensions have been proposed to overcome this problem. We have proved that contrary to what is claimed in the literature, the flux-based model is able to correctly reproduce auxin concentrations within veins. A mathematical analysis permits us to give in a precise way the related parameter regimes. Our analyses show that for quadratic and unbounded response functions Φ, the steady state vascular patterns are formed of directed trees and thus do not contain loops. Moreover, we have proven that PIN concentrations can diverge in finite time, explaining in this way why previous simulation studies were forced to introduce cut-offs to ensure that PIN concentrations remained bounded. On the other hand, we showed that PIN concentrations remain bounded for bounded Φ; simulations suggest that in this case, loops can emerge at steady state. Thus, according to this model, the self-organization of the auxin flux leads to different patterns as a function of the boundedness of Φ. Plants having a tree-like vascular system should therefore be modelled using unbounded Φ, at the risk of recovering unrealistically high values of PIN concentration. Finally, our analysis of source- and sink-driven systems reveals new and surprising results: for sink- driven systems, the auxin flux is directed against auxin gradients, leading to an auxin depleted zone in the neighbourhood of the primordium, while for source-driven systems, a linear vein emerges which can have high auxin concentration and be directed with the auxin gradient. Surprisingly, the latter situation occurs when the auxin production rate of the source is relatively low. This model is thus able to reproduce phylotactic pattern and canalization by varying auxin synthesis and degradation rate in each cell. The remaining question is why a cell becomes a sink or source.</p>
